## How has sound recording transformed modern musical life?  

{{% note %}}
* Why study the history of sound recording? 
* What are the differences between live performances and recordings? Is recorded sound a "mirror of sonic reality"?
* We'll look at these questions in this class.

### Is it live, or is it Memorex?

Can you imagine a time when realism was the most important aspect of sound reproduction?

## Phonograph effect 

> any change in musical behavior—whether listening, performing, or composing—that has arisen in response to sound-recording technology. A phonograph effect is, in other words, any observable manifestation of recording’s influence.
> 
> --Katz

{{% note %}}
* all phonograph effects are ultimately responses to differences between live and recorded music.
* Most broadly, live and recorded music differ in the ways in which they exist in space and time. When performed live, musical sound is fleeting, evanescent. 
* Recordings, however, capture these fugitive sounds, tangibly preserving them on physical media, whether wax cylinders or plastic CDs or silicon computer chips.

> “In America I had arranged with a gramophone firm to make records of some of my music...This suggested the idea that I should compose something whose length should be determined by the capacity of the record. And that is how my Sérénade en LA pour Piano came to be written.

## Causes

* Tangibility
* Portability
* (In)visibility
* Repeatability
* Temporality
* Receptivity

Imagine what it must have been like to experience recorded sound for the first time. What do you think it must have been like for listeners to hear performers who they could not see?

## Tangibility

> “The service a singer performs for me satisfies my aesthetic need, but what I consume exists only in an action inseparable from the singer, and as soon as the singing is over, so too is my consumption.”
>
> --Karl Marx

{{% note %}}
* Think about this quote by Marx about music before recording. 
* Show the cylinders. Let the students touch them. Imagine playing this whenever you want, not relying on performers.
* These cylinders allowed people to "collect" music for the first time. Not just music notation or player piano rolls but a facsimile of the music itself. 
* Are any of you collectors? Does collecting change the way you enjoy music? Can you collect recordings on a streaming service? What is the point of collecting recordings? 
* The tangibility of recordings allowed for duplication and the creation of the music industry. Has access to recordings made the US more or less musical? 
* Are recordings still tangible? Is it important?

## Portability

> “Even the most perfect reproduction of a work of art is lacking in one element: its presence in time and space, its unique existence at the place where it happens to be.”
>
> -- Walter Benjamin, 1936 “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction”

{{% note %}}
- When music becomes a thing, it gains unprecedented freedom to travel.
- Do we agree with Benjamin’s statement? Is it good to have music freed of its presence in “time and space”? He thinks it is good because it frees the work from its dependence on ritual. The ritual of live music seems positive, but maybe Benjamin was thinking of the exclusive world of classical music.

## Portable music 
### The Pico of Cartegena, Colombia

{{% note %}}
* As the picó demonstrates, while recorded music is often decoupled from its origins in space and time, this “loss” begets a contextual promiscuity that allows music to accrue rich and unexpected new meanings.
* More examples of how recording allows music to become decoupled in space and time, as Benjamin wrote about, and how this allows music to take on new meanings.

## (In)visibility

[Edison Realism Test](edison-test.png)

{{% note %}}
* First, you are to choose the type of music you would like to hear. Next you are asked to sit facing away from the phonograph while looking at a scrapbook of concert reviews and photographs of musicians (all Edison recording artists, naturally). Then you are directed to remember the last time you witnessed a performance of the music you have chosen to hear. “Picture the scene,” you are told, until “it is clearly . . . in mind.” Once this mental image is firmly in place, you are to say, “I am ready,” at which point the demonstrator plays your chosen record. The final instruction is wonderfully complicated: “About forty-five seconds after the music begins, close your eyes and keep them closed for a minute or more. Then open your eyes for fifteen seconds but do not gaze at your surroundings. After this, close your eyes again and keep them closed until the end of the selection.” If you follow these directions exactly, you will supposedly get “the same emotional re-action experienced when you last heard the same kind of voice or instrument.” If for some reason you do not, it is because “you have not wholly shaken off the influence of your surroundings,” in which case you are to repeat the test until successful.31
* With recordings, the listener and the performers can't see each other

## Repeatability

> live performances are unique; recordings are repeatable
>
> --Katz

{{% note %}}
* When listeners are repeatedly exposed to note-perfect recordings, do they expect similar live performances? Do performers then feel the need to meet such expectations? 
* Do you expect a band to sound exactly like you heard on the recording when you see them live? 
* What about popular live recordings?

* Then there are styles of music that used the repeatability of recordings as their means of production. 
* Repeatability may have even greater power, and influence the very process of composing. Indeed, recording has begotten whole genres whose identity is fundamentally connected to repetition.

## Temporality

## Receptivity

> no recording equipment, from the simplest acoustic horn to the most sophisticated microphone, is sensitive to sound in the same way as the human ear.
>
> --Katz

{{% note %}}
- What this means is that the music that was recorded needed to be drastically changed to fit the demands of the medium. 
- Soft and loud notes, for instance, demanded drastically different techniques. A vocalist might literally stick her head inside the horn to ensure that her pianissimo would be heard, but then, with the timing of a lion tamer, quickly withdraw for her fortissimo, so as to avoid “blasting” the engraving needle out of its groove. Alternatively, studio assistants would push the artists toward the horn or pull them away according to the changing dynamics of the music.
- What are more modern versions of these phenomena, where recording technology allows new music or forced music in a specific direction?
