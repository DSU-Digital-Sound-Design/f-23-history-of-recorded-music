#### The Ever-changing Life of Clyde Stubblefield's Drum Solo
- Show examples of this from whosampled.com 
- Clyde Stubblefield's drum solo from James Brown’s 1970 R&B song “Funky Drummer” has a "chameleonic existence" with various reinterpretations.
- It takes on different meanings and moods in various songs such as Eric B. and Rakim’s “Lyrics of Fury,” Sinéad O’Connor’s “I Am Stretched on Your Grave,” Sublime’s “Scarlet Begonias,” and George Michael’s “Waiting for That Day.”

#### Digital Sampling as a Technique
- This transformational phenomenon arises from the practice of digital sampling, where a fragment of one recording is incorporated into another.
- Digital sampling has been embraced by musicians from various genres since the 1980s.

#### Questions Raised by Digital Sampling
- The use of this technology raises several questions that span aesthetic, technical, ethical, and legal dimensions.
- Questions include how composers have adapted their work, whether digital sampling represents a new compositional aesthetic, and whether it has led to ethical and legal concerns.

#### Case Studies to Address Questions
- Four case studies are mentioned to explore these questions:
  1. Notjustmoreidlechatter by Paul Lansky, which transforms speech into music.
  2. The relationship between Camille Yarbrough’s “Take Yo’ Praise” and Fatboy Slim’s “Praise You,” where the former is sampled by the latter.
  3. Public Enemy’s “Fight the Power,” whose sampling serves political and cultural agendas.
  4. The phenomenon of the digital mashup, which delves into issues of amateurism and creativity.

This text serves as a comprehensive overview of the evolution and impact of digital sampling, as exemplified through the multiple incarnations of Clyde Stubblefield's drum solo.

#### Definition and Basic Mechanics of Digital Sampling
- Digital sampling is a technology where sound is converted into digital data that can be manipulated and reconstructed.
- Sound waves are digitized through an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) by taking select "samples" of the wave and assigning them binary numbers.
- Reconstruction is done through a digital-to-analog converter (DAC), which closely approximates the original sound.
- Standard sampling rates are typically at 44,100 Hz, with each slice given a sixteen-digit binary number for high granularity.

#### Versatility in Sound Manipulation
- The digitization process allows for highly precise manipulations, such as adjusting tempo and pitch independently.
- Other sound characteristics like reverberation, frequency, and noise can also be tweaked.

#### The Distinction: Performative Quotation
- Digital sampling can capture and recreate minute details like the force with which a drum is hit or the ambient noise in a recording, which it calls "performative quotation."
- Unlike traditional quotations that cite works, digital samples cite performances, bringing in all the timbre and timing details of the original event.

#### Significance and Creative Potential
- Digital sampling sets itself apart through its capability for performative quotation, enabling a myriad of creative works in modern music.
  
This summary delves into the various facets of digital sampling, from its basic technological framework to its broader implications in musical creativity and borrowing. It underscores the revolutionary aspect of digital sampling as a form of "performative quotation," which opens up vast creative possibilities.

## Camille Yarbrough - Take Yo' praise

<iframe id='ivplayer' width='640' height='360' src='https://inv.zzls.xyz/embed/sGQbtyctPmE?t=28' style='border:none;'></iframe>

{{% note %}}
- **Origin of the Voice Sample:**
  - The voice in "Praise You" is identified as Camille Yarbrough's, originally from her 1975 soul/funk song “Take Yo’ Praise.”
  - The songs are available for comparison on a companion Web site.

- **Digital Sampling Technique:**
  - Norman Cook has used digital sampling to both decontextualize and recontextualize Yarbrough’s voice, creating new sounds, functions, and meanings.

- **The Surprise in Sampling:**
  - Cook only samples the first twenty seconds of “Take Yo’ Praise,” which features unaccompanied singing by Yarbrough.
  - Listeners often mistakenly believe that the opening of “Praise You” is an unaltered live performance recording.

- **Cook's Additions and Manipulations:**
  - Cook added the piano, background voices, and enhanced the crackling LP sound from which the piano was sampled.
  - He altered Yarbrough’s singing by increasing the tempo and flattening the melodic contour.

- **Achieving Wholeness and Nostalgia:**

- Interpretations and Implications

{{% note %}}
### Summary with Bullet Points

- **Original Song vs. Sampled Version:**
  - Yarbrough's original song had a funky bass line, guitar, and percussion, evolving into a passionate, erotic piece with a postcoital coda.
  - Cook's version diverges after the first sixteen measures, with a vocal stutter and a synthesized drum, creating an intentionally clumsy effect to highlight the sampling.

- **Cook's Intention and Techniques:**
  - The vocal stutter was Cook's way of drawing attention to the act of sampling.
  - The first four seconds of "Praise You" are looped, revealing the digital construction of the piece.

- **Variation and Repetition in Cook's Version:**
  - Cook repeats Yarbrough's singing and the last line, "I have to praise you like I should," creating variation through changing accompaniments.
  - Despite being dance music, Cook's version has subtle elements that reward attentive listening, contrary to Cook's own belief that his music is not meant for analytical listening.

- **Reduction of Original Meaning:**
  - Cook removes the complex, multifaceted love message and the broader social context of Yarbrough's original song.
  - The repetition of a few words diminishes the lyrical significance, leading to its perception as a fun, non-serious track.

- **Gender Ambiguity and Digital Neutering:**
  - Cook's alterations lead listeners to question the singer's gender or assume it's a man.
  - The technique of time-stretching, which changed Yarbrough's voice's nuances, contributes to the gender ambiguity.
  - Cook's version lacks the original song's eroticism, rendering the voice asexual and potentially disempowering Yarbrough.

- **Potential Interpretations and Implications:**
  - Yarbrough's voice could be seen as a free-floating signifier, making the song universally relatable.
  - Alternatively, Cook's sampling could be viewed as disempowering Yarbrough by erasing her history, identity, and vitality.

## Ethical considerations 

### Appropriation or Homage? 

{{% note %}}
- **Appropriation or Homage**: The song "Praise You" by Fatboy Slim (Cook) raises questions about whether it's another case of a white musician appropriating black culture. However, the situation is nuanced.
  
- **Yarbrough's Reaction**: Camille Yarbrough, the original artist, was pleasantly surprised by Cook's version and appreciated the emotional core and gospel quality he maintained, even though she was ambivalent about the "dance hall" sound.

- **Profit and Fame**: There's an unequal power dynamic, with Cook being more popular and wealthy. Yet, Yarbrough didn't view Cook's adaptation as diminishing her work and acknowledged the financial benefits she received.

- **Cook's Perspective**: Cook claims his intention isn't profit but love for the music. He ensured Yarbrough received credit and a significant share of the royalties, learning from a past experience where he didn't secure rights beforehand.

- **Impact on Yarbrough**: "Praise You" brought renewed attention to Yarbrough and her music, leading to financial gains and a reevaluation of her place in popular music.

- **Student Reactions**: Some students felt Yarbrough was exploited despite her acceptance of Cook's version and the financial compensation.

- **Complexity in Digital Sampling**: The case exemplifies the complexities of digital sampling, raising questions about creativity, originality, and ethics, and forcing a confrontation with issues of gender, class, and race.
