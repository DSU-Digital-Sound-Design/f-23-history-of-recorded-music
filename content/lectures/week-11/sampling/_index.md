### Summary: Evolution and Impact of Digital Sampling Through Clyde Stubblefield’s "Funky Drummer"

#### The Ever-changing Life of Clyde Stubblefield's Drum Solo
- Show examples of this from whosampled.com 
- Clyde Stubblefield's drum solo from James Brown’s 1970 R&B song “Funky Drummer” has a "chameleonic existence" with various reinterpretations.
- It takes on different meanings and moods in various songs such as Eric B. and Rakim’s “Lyrics of Fury,” Sinéad O’Connor’s “I Am Stretched on Your Grave,” Sublime’s “Scarlet Begonias,” and George Michael’s “Waiting for That Day.”

#### Digital Sampling as a Technique
- This transformational phenomenon arises from the practice of digital sampling, where a fragment of one recording is incorporated into another.
- Digital sampling has been embraced by musicians from various genres since the 1980s.

#### Questions Raised by Digital Sampling
- The use of this technology raises several questions that span aesthetic, technical, ethical, and legal dimensions.
- Questions include how composers have adapted their work, whether digital sampling represents a new compositional aesthetic, and whether it has led to ethical and legal concerns.

#### Case Studies to Address Questions
- Four case studies are mentioned to explore these questions:
  1. Notjustmoreidlechatter by Paul Lansky, which transforms speech into music.
  2. The relationship between Camille Yarbrough’s “Take Yo’ Praise” and Fatboy Slim’s “Praise You,” where the former is sampled by the latter.
  3. Public Enemy’s “Fight the Power,” whose sampling serves political and cultural agendas.
  4. The phenomenon of the digital mashup, which delves into issues of amateurism and creativity.

This text serves as a comprehensive overview of the evolution and impact of digital sampling, as exemplified through the multiple incarnations of Clyde Stubblefield's drum solo.

#### Definition and Basic Mechanics of Digital Sampling
- Digital sampling is a technology where sound is converted into digital data that can be manipulated and reconstructed.
- Sound waves are digitized through an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) by taking select "samples" of the wave and assigning them binary numbers.
- Reconstruction is done through a digital-to-analog converter (DAC), which closely approximates the original sound.
- Standard sampling rates are typically at 44,100 Hz, with each slice given a sixteen-digit binary number for high granularity.

#### Versatility in Sound Manipulation
- The digitization process allows for highly precise manipulations, such as adjusting tempo and pitch independently.
- Other sound characteristics like reverberation, frequency, and noise can also be tweaked.

#### Historical Context: Digital Sampling vs Traditional Musical Borrowing
- Digital sampling has roots that go back over a millennium in Western musical tradition, involving adaptations and incorporations of pre-existing music.
- However, the text argues that while traditional musical borrowing is a representation of another piece, digital sampling is a more complex form of quotation.

#### The Distinction: Performative Quotation
- Digital sampling can capture and recreate minute details like the force with which a drum is hit or the ambient noise in a recording, which it calls "performative quotation."
- Unlike traditional quotations that cite works, digital samples cite performances, bringing in all the timbre and timing details of the original event.

#### Significance and Creative Potential
- Digital sampling sets itself apart through its capability for performative quotation, enabling a myriad of creative works in modern music.
  
This summary delves into the various facets of digital sampling, from its basic technological framework to its broader implications in musical creativity and borrowing. It underscores the revolutionary aspect of digital sampling as a form of "performative quotation," which opens up vast creative possibilities.

### Summary in Bullet Points

#### Initial Experience and Reflection
- Author couldn't initially understand Dutch announcement on KLM flight.
- Realization led to thoughts on how familiar sounds can become unfamiliar, coining the term "aural squinting."

#### Paul Lansky and His Work
- Paul Lansky is a music professor at Princeton specializing in digitally manipulated speech.
- "Notjustmoreidlechatter" uses a digitally manipulated reading from "Jane Eyre," creating a complex musical texture.

#### The Challenge of Recorded Music
- Lansky addresses how to make music that is solely recorded.
- Introduces unpredictability using stochastic techniques, engaging the listener as an active participant.

#### Balancing Complexity and Simplicity
- The piece includes both rapidly moving manipulated voices and slow harmonic background singers.
- Uses an arch structure, with voices becoming clearer at the midpoint before fading.

#### Redefining Music and Listener Experience
- Lansky's work blurs the line between noise and music, challenging traditional definitions.
- Emphasizes the listener's role in interpreting and defining the music.

#### Essence and Success of Music
- Lansky believes the essence of music lies in the act of trying to understand it.
- Argues that music's success is gauged by its emotional and aesthetic impact, not its technological complexity.
