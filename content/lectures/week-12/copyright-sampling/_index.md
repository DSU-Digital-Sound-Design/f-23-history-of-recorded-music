## Sampling, Interpolations, Beat Stores, and More: An Introduction for Musicians Using Preexisting Music


{{% note %}}
Welcome, everyone. Today, we embark on a journey through the evolving world of music production in the digital era. We'll look at how technological advancements have democratized music creation, allowing artists to blend their own recordings with preexisting works. Understanding copyright will be a recurring theme, as it's a critical aspect for anyone in the music industry today.

## The Ease of Creating Music Today

- Rise of digital production platforms
- Access to a wide range of musical pieces
- Importance of copyright knowledge

{{% note %}}
In this section, we will discuss how the digital revolution has simplified music production. Platforms like beat stores have opened a plethora of opportunities for musicians. Yet, with great power comes great responsibility – the responsibility to respect and understand the copyright laws that govern the use of preexisting music.

# Case Example
## "Old Town Road" by Lil Nas X

- A viral hit's backstory
- Sampling controversies and success
- Learning from real-world examples

[Lil Nas X's 'Old Town Road' sample of Nine Inch Nails's '34 Ghosts IV' | WhoSampled](https://www.whosampled.com/sample/632901/Lil-Nas-X-Old-Town-Road-Nine-Inch-Nails-34-Ghosts-IV/)

{{% note %}}
"Old Town Road" serves as an excellent case study to illustrate the potential of using preexisting music to create a hit. We'll dissect the song's journey from a sample to a viral sensation, the controversies it sparked, and what musicians can learn from Lil Nas X's experience regarding copyright.

> One of the most successful songs based on a beat from
a beat store is Lil Nas X’s “Old Town Road.” The basis for
this song was the song “34 Ghosts IV,” written by Trent
Reznor and Atticus Ross and recorded by Nine Inch Nails.
Producer YoungKio used the Nine Inch Nails song to make
a beat, which he made available online in a beat store.
Lil Nas X purchased a license to use that beat and then
added lyrics to create “Old Town Road.” He later recorded
a remixed version of the song featuring Billy Ray Cyrus.

# Understanding Copyright
## Musical Works vs. Sound Recordings

- Different types of copyright
  - a musical work is a song’s underlying composition
  created by a songwriter or composer along with any
  accompanying lyrics.
  - A sound recording is a series of musical,
  spoken, or other sounds fixed in a recording medium, such
  as a CD or digital file

{{% note %}}
Understanding copyright is fundamental for every musician. This slide will explain the differences between copyright protection for musical compositions and sound recordings. This knowledge is crucial when deciding to sample a tune or use a beat from another artist.

in short, a musical work is a song’s underlying composition
created by a songwriter or composer along with any
accompanying lyrics. A sound recording is a series of musical,
spoken, or other sounds fixed in a recording medium, such
as a CD or digital file

## Sampling, Mashups, and Remixes

> **Sampling** involves taking part of an existing sound recording
and incorporating it into a new work. For example, a piano
line or guitar riff from one recording might be used as a
melody in a new recording (instead of re-recording the
melody or creating a new melody), or the audio from drums
or a piano might be incorporated into a new sound recording
as the rhythm or melody of the new work.

Sampling, mashups, and remixes are common methods of incorporating preexisting music into new creations. Here, we'll define each term, provide examples, and discuss the balance between creative expression and legal obligations, including the necessity of obtaining proper clearances.

# Legal Considerations
## Interpolations and Covers

- Understanding interpolation
- Legal framework for cover songs
- Obtaining necessary permissions
- The following songs contain interpolations:
  - Nas’s “I Can” interpolates Beethoven’s “Für Elise”
  -  Flo Rida’s “Right Round” interpolates Dead or Alive’s “You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)”
  -  Ariana Grande’s “7 Rings” interpolates Rodgers and Hammerstein’s “My Favorite Things”

{{% note %}}
Interpolation and cover songs can enrich new music, but they come with their own legal considerations. We'll delve into the practical aspects of how to legally interpolate a song, the differences from cover songs, and the process for obtaining the rights to use someone else's music.

To make a cover, you can either secure a license from the
musical work copyright owner or secure what is known as
a statutory (or compulsory) mechanical license. A statutory
mechanical license operates by law, which means that a
musical work copyright owner cannot normally say “no,” if
all legal requirements are satisfied. This license can only be
obtained for nondramatic musical works. Complying with
this license can be complicated. There are several specific
rules that need to be carefully followed, including rules
on who is eligible for the license, how much money (or
“royalties”) must be paid to use the license, and other details.

If you secure a statutory mechanical license, you are allowed to
make a musical arrangement of the work, but the arrangement
cannot “change the basic melody or fundamental character of
the work.”

Remember that recording a cover involves separate rights from
performing a cover—in most (although not all) cases, musical
works’ public performance rights are licensed by performance
rights organizations

# Beat Stores
## Understanding the Terms and Agreements

- Licensing beats online
- Exclusive vs. non-exclusive rights
- Importance of understanding contracts

{{% note %}}
Beat stores are a boon for modern musicians, but the licensing agreements can be complex. We'll navigate the terms and agreements commonly found in these online marketplaces, discuss the differences between exclusive and non-exclusive licenses, and emphasize why a thorough understanding of these contracts is essential for protecting your work.

# Fair Use and Public Domain

- Defining fair use
  -  the purpose and character of the use, including whether
such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit
educational purposes;
  - the nature of the copyrighted work (including
considering whether the work is creative vs. factual or
published vs. unpublished);
  - the amount and substantiality of the portion used in
relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and
  - the effect of the use upon the potential market for or
value of the copyrighted work.
- Criteria for public domain works
- Navigating copyright without infringement

{{% note %}}
Fair use and public domain are two areas that can be confusing for musicians. In this part, we will clarify what constitutes fair use, how to identify if a work is in the public domain, and how these concepts can be applied to use preexisting music legally without requiring permission.

Fair use is a legal doctrine that promotes
freedom of expression by permitting the unlicensed use of
copyright-protected works in certain circumstances. When a
court determines whether a use is a fair use, it will evaluate
at least the following four factors:

**Public Domain**
A work is in the “public domain” if it is no longer under
copyright protection or if it failed to meet the requirements
for copyright protection. Works in the public domain
may be used freely without the permission of a copyright
owner—you do not need to secure a license to use them.
But be careful to remember that musical works and sound
recordings are different works. If you want to make a copy,
interpolation, or performance of a musical work in the
public domain in the United States—for example, Grieg’s
“In the Hall of the Mountain King”—you can. But if you
want to make a copy or sample of the Offspring’s sound
recording of “In the Hall of the Mountain King,” you could
not do so without permission, because the Offspring’s
sound recording is not in the public domain. Also, remember
that a work may be in the public domain in some countries
but still protected by copyright in other countries.

Common Musical Building Blocks
Nobody can prevent you from using common building
blocks such as scales, chords, or arpeggios. For example,
even though Jimi Hendrix was known for using the “Hendrix
Chord” (a dominant 7th chord with a sharp 9th), any other
musician can use that chord in their songs. Similarly, short
musical phrases would not be protected by copyright, even
if other elements of the song are protected
