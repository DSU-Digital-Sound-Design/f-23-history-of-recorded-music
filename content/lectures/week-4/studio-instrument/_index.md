# When High Fidelity Was New

## The Studio as Instrument

{{% note %}}

**Recording studio developments**

- Record sales rebounded before World War II, leading to increased attention on record quality and studio acoustics.
- Records couldn't replicate live performance reverberation due to limitations like extraneous noise from shellac discs and limited phonograph frequency range.
- In the 1920s, issues with reverberations and echoes led studios to adopt acoustically dead environments to minimize these problems.
- Early 1930s saw the use of "live end" and "dead end" studios and echo chambers in radio stations to enhance music and speech broadcasts.
- Halls and churches with natural reverberation characteristics became preferred recording environments, gaining a strong reputation.
- Recording studios developed unique acoustical signatures known as their "sound."
- Engineers devised methods to recreate these acoustics in smaller spaces.

**Reverb**

- Reverberation, once eliminated from public spaces and movie sound studios, gained importance in music recording during the early days of high fidelity.
- It was valued not only for aiding singers but also for making records sound louder.
- Controlling reverberation became essential for successful utilization in recordings.
- Achieving a realistic sound required the skillful manipulation of recording equipment and microphone placement by recording engineers.
- Some record producers aimed to go beyond replicating live performances, emphasizing additional elements for the listener.
- This shift marked an increased significance of studio technology, design, and the roles of producers and engineers in recording sessions.

The upswing in record sales began in 1934 when RCA revived its long-dormant recording division by advertising phonograph records in radio trade magazines, and a new company, Decca Records, introduced the thirty-five-cent record that featured jazz and popular music by name artists such as Bing Crosby, Chick Webb, Ella Fitzgerald, and the Mills Brothers

- In 1938, Lafayette introduced the “modernized” home phonograph with “bass boosting” and “high fidelity” response. This phonograph was marketed as more capable of faithfully reproducing the improved quality of records.
- The popularity of jukeboxes and swing bands and the continued improvement in the quality of re- cords and phonographs further fueled record sales, which, by 1939, had reached an annual gross figure of $36 million industry-wide, six times the sales figure of 1933, the industry’s worst year.

Moreover, consumers had grown more musically and technically sophisticated; even young listeners, according to one New York Times report, debated the relative merits of pickups, amplification, and needles “with the glibness of scientists’ shoptalk.”

Even during the ban, which forbade union musicians from making commercial recordings or transcriptions, American Federation of Musicians president James C. Petrillo permitted musicians to play on recording sessions for the Armed Forces Radio Service and the V-Disc program, which ran from October 1943 to May 1949. V-Disc recording kept mu- sicians and a handful of engineers and producers working during the war years when record companies were forced to cut back because of matériel shortages.

In New York, NBC completed its massive Radio City studio complex in 1933. The structure cost five million dollars, more than half of which was used for sound equipment and acoustic treatment.

> THE world's largest and finest radio -broadcasting studios are now in operation at Radio City, New York. Built by the National Broadcasting Company at an outlay of five million dollars, they incorporate many novel features of design and arrangement, in addition to their sheer size and completeness. Thirty-five studios of various sizes are p

The designers incorporated elaborate means of achieving sound isolation, such as “floating construction” of walls, triple-pane plate-glass observation windows, and many types of acousti- cal treatment—rock wool, perforated asbestos tiles, and proprietary materials such as Rockoustile, Acoustone, and Acousti-Celotex—on the walls and even within the building’s air ducts.

NBC engineers stressed that their design cri- teria were set not by “the critical judgment of comparatively few people” but by “years of operating experience and the collective judgment and opinion of thousands of listeners.” In other words, while broadcast studio design was “no longer a matter of guesswork or ‘trial and error’ methods,” neither was it deter- mined solely by theoretical analysis but also by what sounded good to the lis- tening public

In 1940, CBS remodeled a former school of music located across the street from its East Fifty-Second Street headquarters for its new broadcasting studios. The designers incorporated innovations in room design and acoustical treatment “intended to result in studios more ‘live,’ or brilliant, than any built up to the present time.”
