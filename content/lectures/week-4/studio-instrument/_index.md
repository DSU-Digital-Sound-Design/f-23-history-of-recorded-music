# When High Fidelity Was New

## The Studio as Instrument

{{% note %}}

**Recording studio developments**

- Record sales rebounded before World War II, leading to increased attention on record quality and studio acoustics.
- Records couldn't replicate live performance reverberation due to limitations like extraneous noise from shellac discs and limited phonograph frequency range.
- In the 1920s, issues with reverberations and echoes led studios to adopt acoustically dead environments to minimize these problems.
- Early 1930s saw the use of "live end" and "dead end" studios and echo chambers in radio stations to enhance music and speech broadcasts.
- Halls and churches with natural reverberation characteristics became preferred recording environments, gaining a strong reputation.
- Recording studios developed unique acoustical signatures known as their "sound."
- Engineers devised methods to recreate these acoustics in smaller spaces.

**Reverb**

- Reverberation, once eliminated from public spaces and movie sound studios, gained importance in music recording during the early days of high fidelity.
- It was valued not only for aiding singers but also for making records sound louder.
- Controlling reverberation became essential for successful utilization in recordings.
- Achieving a realistic sound required the skillful manipulation of recording equipment and microphone placement by recording engineers.
- Some record producers aimed to go beyond replicating live performances, emphasizing additional elements for the listener.
- This shift marked an increased significance of studio technology, design, and the roles of producers and engineers in recording sessions.

- The recording in question showcases a blend of dead room and live room ambience, noticeable through distinct characteristics in different elements.
- The lead vocalist's sound appears dry, resembling a performance in a vocal booth, creating a dead room effect.
- In contrast, the brass section, trombone solo, drummer's rim shots emulating bat sounds, and the male chorus exude a significant presence, highlighting the room's spaciousness.
- Achieving volume without exceeding groove dimensions was a key concern in those days, as louder records required wider grooves and resulted in reduced playing time.
- Studios capable of delivering an apparent loudness quality were highly prized, both artistically and commercially, during the big band era.

**Closing of Liederkrantz Hall**

- In the late 1940s, Columbia Records thrived as a label, while its parent company, the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS), had a rising presence in television.
- CBS President William S. Paley made a significant decision to convert Liederkranz Hall into television studios.
- This decision was met with apparent unpopularity, and it ultimately led to the destruction of the hall's legendary sound.
- According to musician Manny Albam, the hall's remarkable acoustics were ruined by a simple act of applying a coat of paint, resulting in the demise of the studio.

- Columbia Records eventually discovered an ideal venue in an abandoned Greek Orthodox Church located on East Thirtieth Street.
- This studio was built on a foundation of solid rock, and its floors consisted of three layers of one-inch-thick maple and pine, serving as a solid wood sounding board.
- Over time, Columbia's 30th Street Studio gained a remarkable reputation as "the 'Stradivarius' of recording studios."
- It was revered to the extent that it was considered not just a studio but also the ultimate designation as a musical instrument itself.

Parabolic reflectors in recording studios, bullet points:

* Savory designed 8-foot parabolic reflectors on wheeled tripods for easy repositioning.
* He placed the reflectors behind musicians to give recording engineers more control over the sound and musicians a better listening environment.
* Brass musicians thought the reflectors were wonderful, while some other musicians found them strange.
* One violinist told Savory that the reflectors would make him practice more because he could hear all his mistakes.

In summary, parabolic reflectors can be used in recording studios to create a more direct sound and reduce reverberation. However, some musicians may find them strange or uncomfortable.

**Summary of the Les Paul echo effect story in bullet points:**

* Les Paul witnessed two Chicago radio engineers serendipitously invent a makeshift echo effect.
* The engineers were trying to create the sound of thunder for a soap opera.
* They removed the needle from a phonograph pickup, inserted a long spring, and hit the spring with a mallet.
* This created the crashing sound of thunder.
* The engineers then put a pickup on the other end of the spring to receive the signal.
* This created an echo effect.

Paul was amazed by this new echo effect, and he began to use it in his own music. He is credited with popularizing the use of echo effects in guitar music.

* This experiment became the **Spring reverb:** A type of echo effect composed of an electromechanical system that was later incorporated into the Hammond organ.
* **Invented by Laurens Hammond in 1935:** Laurens Hammond was an American inventor who is best known for inventing the Hammond organ.

* [Vintage EMT 140 Plate Reverb vs. Reverb Plug-Ins Shootout | Vintage King - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROCDQNpPEe0)

{{% note %}}

* The EMT 140 Reverberation Set, developed in 1953, was a popular electronic means of achieving reverb.
* It consisted of a large steel plate that was excited by a loudspeaker-like device and picked up by a microphone.
* The reverb time could be adjusted between one and five seconds.
* The EMT plate was portable, tunable, and size-efficient, making it a good option for studios with limited space.
* Not everyone immediately embraced this new form of electronic reverberation.

**Additional thoughts:**

* The EMT 140 Reverberation Set was a major breakthrough in reverb technology. It was the first commercially available electronic reverb unit, and it quickly became a standard in recording studios around the world.
* The EMT plate was known for its smooth, natural-sounding reverb. It was used on countless classic recordings, including "Pet Sounds" by The Beatles and "Thriller" by Michael Jackson.
* Although the EMT plate was not immediately embraced by everyone, it eventually became widely accepted as a valuable tool for recording engineers and producers.

Overall, the EMT 140 Reverberation Set was a landmark product in the history of recording technology. It helped to shape the sound of recorded music for generations.

**Reluctance in adoption:**

* Although the EMT plate offered more control over reverb than natural spaces, engineers, producers, and artists were initially resistant to using it because they wanted to be sure that they would get the desired sound from a trusted source.
* They were concerned that the EMT plate would not sound as natural as the live chambers that had been used to record so many hit records.
* Phil Ramone was able to dispel their doubts by camouflaging his EMTs and conducting a "tone test." His clients were none the wiser, and the EMT plate quickly became a standard in recording studios around the world.

**Additional thoughts:**

* Ramone's "tone test" is a fascinating example of how the psychology of perception can play a role in the adoption of new technologies. Even though the EMT plate sounded just as good as, or even better than, live chambers, many engineers and producers were reluctant to use it because they were unfamiliar with it and didn't trust it.
* Ramone's experiment showed that once people got used to the sound of the EMT plate, they couldn't tell the difference between it and a live chamber. This helped to pave the way for the widespread adoption of electronic reverb units.

Overall, the bullet points you provided provide a good overview of the early resistance to electronic reverb and how Ramone's "tone test" helped to overcome it. It is a reminder that even when a new technology is clearly superior to the old one, it can take time for people to accept it.

{{% note %}}
* In addition to echo chambers, another popular means of achieving echo in the early days of recording was tape slap, or slap-back echo. This was done by using two tape recorders and recording the signal onto one recorder, then playing it back on the other recorder and re-recording it onto the first recorder. The time delay between the two recordings could be adjusted to create a variety of echo effects.
* Les Paul and Sam Phillips were two of the early pioneers of tape slap echo. Paul used it on his own recordings in the late 1940s, and Phillips used it to create the distinctive "Sun Sound" on the first Elvis Presley and Jerry Lee Lewis records.

**Additional thoughts:**

* Tape slap echo is a simple but effective way to create echo effects. It is still used by recording engineers today, although it has been largely replaced by digital reverb units.
* Tape slap echo has a unique sound that is characterized by its short delay time and bright, clear tone. It is often used to create a sense of space and depth in recordings, and it can also be used to add excitement and energy to a track.
* Some famous examples of songs that use tape slap echo include:

    * "How High the Moon" by Les Paul
    * "Jailhouse Rock" by Elvis Presley
    * "Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On" by Jerry Lee Lewis
    * "Johnny B. Goode" by Chuck Berry
    * "Be My Baby" by The Ronettes

Tape slap echo is an important part of the history of recorded music, and it continues to be used by recording engineers today to create unique and interesting sounds.
