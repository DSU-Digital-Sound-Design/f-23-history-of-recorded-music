# When High Fidelity Was New

## The Studio as Instrument

{{% note %}}

**Recording studio developments**

- Record sales rebounded before World War II, leading to increased attention on record quality and studio acoustics.
- Records couldn't replicate live performance reverberation due to limitations like extraneous noise from shellac discs and limited phonograph frequency range.
- In the 1920s, issues with reverberations and echoes led studios to adopt acoustically dead environments to minimize these problems.
- Early 1930s saw the use of "live end" and "dead end" studios and echo chambers in radio stations to enhance music and speech broadcasts.
- Halls and churches with natural reverberation characteristics became preferred recording environments, gaining a strong reputation.
- Recording studios developed unique acoustical signatures known as their "sound."
- Engineers devised methods to recreate these acoustics in smaller spaces.

**Reverb**

- Reverberation, once eliminated from public spaces and movie sound studios, gained importance in music recording during the early days of high fidelity.
- It was valued not only for aiding singers but also for making records sound louder.
- Controlling reverberation became essential for successful utilization in recordings.
- Achieving a realistic sound required the skillful manipulation of recording equipment and microphone placement by recording engineers.
- Some record producers aimed to go beyond replicating live performances, emphasizing additional elements for the listener.
- This shift marked an increased significance of studio technology, design, and the roles of producers and engineers in recording sessions.

- In 1938, Lafayette introduced the “modernized” home phonograph with “bass boosting” and “high fidelity” response. This phonograph was marketed as more capable of faithfully reproducing the improved quality of records.
- The popularity of jukeboxes and swing bands and the continued improvement in the quality of re- cords and phonographs further fueled record sales, which, by 1939, had reached an annual gross figure of $36 million industry-wide, six times the sales figure of 1933, the industry’s worst year.

Moreover, consumers had grown more musically and technically sophisticated; even young listeners, according to one New York Times report, debated the relative merits of pickups, amplification, and needles “with the glibness of scientists’ shoptalk.”

In 1940, CBS remodeled a former school of music located across the street from its East Fifty-Second Street headquarters for its new broadcasting studios. The designers incorporated innovations in room design and acoustical treatment “intended to result in studios more ‘live,’ or brilliant, than any built up to the present time.”

## Western Electric 22C console

The studio had padded walls and rugs on the floor, a control room with a simple RCA recording console, and since the recording was made on hot wax, the musicians could not hear a playback until they received test pressings a week later.

{{% note %}}
- Recording consoles in recording studios evolved from the original control panels of the Western Electric electrical recording system.
- RCA Victor and Columbia Recording used consoles designed and built by their respective engineering departments.
- Smaller recording studios utilized broadcast consoles manufactured by companies such as RCA, Raytheon, Western Electric, and Gates Radio.
- The engineer's control over the consoles primarily included adjusting input volume from microphones and output to the disc cutter, as well as balancing instruments.
- The popular microphones during the era were RCA ribbon microphones, specifically the diamond-shaped RCA 44 bidirectional and the bullet-shaped RCA 77 unidirectional.
- These microphones were developed in the early 1930s in RCA laboratories under the guidance of Dr. Harry Olson.
- RCA 44 and RCA 77 microphones became widely adopted in studio recording during the 1930s and 1940s.

* George Avakian's first recording session was at Decca Records in 1939. He was a 20-year-old college student and a self-confessed jazz fanatic.
* He organized and produced a six-disc album titled Chicago Jazz, which Decca released in 1940.
* The album featured original recordings of musicians associated with the Chicago school of jazz, including Eddie Condon, Pee Wee Russell, Bud Freeman, and Jimmy McPartland.
* Avakian's Chicago Jazz was the first jazz album with original recordings, as opposed to reissued recordings.

This album was significant because it was the first of its kind, and it helped to introduce the Chicago school of jazz to a wider audience. It also helped to solidify Avakian's reputation as one of the leading jazz producers of his time.

## Capitol

**Capitol Records**

* Founded in 1942 by songwriter Johnny Mercer, music store owner Glenn Wallichs, and film producer Buddy DeSylva.
* First Los Angeles–based label to achieve major status.
* By 1945, had claimed sales just behind Decca, one of the "Big Three" record labels at the time.

This is a significant accomplishment for Capitol Records, as it was able to compete with the established record labels in New York City. It also shows the growing importance of Los Angeles in the music industry.

## Temples, Churches, and Dance Halls: The Big “Natural” Sound


{{% note %}}

- In-house studios of record labels during the 1940s and 1950s were insufficiently spacious for orchestras or big bands.
- Record companies frequently sought alternate venues for large ensemble recordings.
- Certain large recording venues possessed natural acoustics suitable for symphonic music and big band jazz recordings.
- These venues, while acoustically favorable, were not originally designed to be soundproof.
- Engineers had to develop methods to reduce the impact of unwanted external sounds that the recording equipment might capture during sessions.

## Recorded at Liederkranz Hall (1941)

- The recording in question showcases a blend of dead room and live room ambience, noticeable through distinct characteristics in different elements.
- The lead vocalist's sound appears dry, resembling a performance in a vocal booth, creating a dead room effect.
- In contrast, the brass section, trombone solo, drummer's rim shots emulating bat sounds, and the male chorus exude a significant presence, highlighting the room's spaciousness.
- Achieving volume without exceeding groove dimensions was a key concern in those days, as louder records required wider grooves and resulted in reduced playing time.
- Studios capable of delivering an apparent loudness quality were highly prized, both artistically and commercially, during the big band era.

**Closing of Liederkrantz Hall**

- In the late 1940s, Columbia Records thrived as a label, while its parent company, the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS), had a rising presence in television.
- CBS President William S. Paley made a significant decision to convert Liederkranz Hall into television studios.
- This decision was met with apparent unpopularity, and it ultimately led to the destruction of the hall's legendary sound.
- According to musician Manny Albam, the hall's remarkable acoustics were ruined by a simple act of applying a coat of paint, resulting in the demise of the studio.

- Columbia Records eventually discovered an ideal venue in an abandoned Greek Orthodox Church located on East Thirtieth Street.
- This studio was built on a foundation of solid rock, and its floors consisted of three layers of one-inch-thick maple and pine, serving as a solid wood sounding board.
- Over time, Columbia's 30th Street Studio gained a remarkable reputation as "the 'Stradivarius' of recording studios."
- It was revered to the extent that it was considered not just a studio but also the ultimate designation as a musical instrument itself.
