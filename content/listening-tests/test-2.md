| The Beach Boys          | Pet Sounds                            | 1966 | **Multitracking:** Brian Wilson used multitrack recording to layer and blend different instruments and vocals. This was a relatively new technique at the time, and Wilson was one of the first producers to use it to such great effect. **Unusual instrumentation:** Wilson used a wide variety of instruments on Pet Sounds, including guitars, bass, drums, piano, organ, and even a theremin. This was unusual for pop music at the time, and it helped to create the album's unique sound.| [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mh_yhTyae08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mh_yhTyae08)                                                                                                                       |

| The Beatles             | Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band | 1967 | Strawberry Fields forever: The song as we know it is not one single take, but two takes (7 and 26) spliced together by producer George Martin and his innovative engineer Geoff Emerick. The Beatles had recorded these two takes at slightly different tempos and pitches. By speeding up the slower of the two tracks, Emerick was able to match the tempo and pitch.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtXl8xAPAtA&list=PL3PhWT10BW3VDM5IcVodrdUpVIhU8f7Z-](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtXl8xAPAtA&list=PL3PhWT10BW3VDM5IcVodrdUpVIhU8f7Z-)                                       |
