title: "Final Project: Analog + Outboard" 
---

#### Introduction
Welcome to the culmination of our journey through music recording history. Your final project will challenge you to apply the analog techniques weâ€™ve studied by creating a music production that is a testament to the rich, warm sound of outboard gear. Below you will find the roadmap to your project, focusing on the Toft ATB Mixer as your primary tool for both recording and mixdown.

#### Project Aim
Create a music production of at least three minutes, using the Toft ATB Mixer for all recording and mixing stages. Your final deliverable will be a stereo mix file that showcases your technical skill with the mixer and outboard gear, as well as your artistic creativity.

#### Equipment and Facilities
You will have at your disposal:
- [Toft ATB Mixer](http://toftaudio.com/ta19/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/ATB_Manual_web.pdf)
- [PRO VLA Two Channel Vactrol/Tube Leveling Amplifier](https://artproaudio.com/framework/uploads/2018/06/Pro-VLAII-manual-v105.pdf)
- [Alesis Dual 1/3 Octave Precision Equalizer](https://data2.manualslib.com/pdf/1/41/4016-alesis/meq230.pdf?fc4836d47d39c415d10544073cdb5b9e)
- [dbx 166XL Compressor / Limiter / Gate](https://data2.manualslib.com/pdf/4/361/36019-dbx/166xl.pdf?a69cb2619076539e4f8c915feca85618)
- Homemade reverb chamber
- A selection of instruments from our instrument room
- Various microphones
- Recording spaces including a vocal booth and a large auditorium

#### Recording Process
- **All recordings must pass through the Toft ATB Mixer**. 
- **Choose your recording space wisely**. The vocal booth is suitable for dry, isolated sounds, while the auditorium can offer natural reverberation and ambience.

#### Mixing Process
- **Your mixdown will also be conducted using the Toft ATB Mixer**. Use its EQ, buses, and aux sends creatively to blend your tracks into a polished piece.


#### Documentation
- **Document each step with photos**. Whether it's setting up mics, adjusting the mixer, or tweaking outboard gear settings, visual evidence is key. Show how each sound source was routed through the mixer and outboard gear.
- **Write a comprehensive report**. Explain your artistic decisions, technical strategies, and provide a thorough self-assessment.

#### Final Deliverable
- **A stereo mix file**. This file, a direct output from the Toft ATB Mixer, will be your final submission. It should reflect your skills in both the technical and artistic realms of music production.

#### Submission Format
- A high-quality stereo mix file.
- A digital portfolio containing all process documentation and photographs.
- A written report including self-assessment, artistic rationale, and technical methodology.

#### Project Timeline
- **Check-In/Mentorship Sessions**: Scheduled individually 
- **Final Submission**: December 7th, 1:00 PM
