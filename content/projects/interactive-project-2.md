title: "Interactive Project 2 StoryMap: 1940s - 1960s"
---

Create a ten slide presentation with the StoryMap tool. Pick a piece of technology that has developed over time and in different places as the topic for your StoryMap project. 

> [StoryMapJS](https://storymap.knightlab.com/) is a free tool to help you tell stories on the web that highlight the locations of a series of events. It is a new tool, yet stable in our development environment, and it has a friendly authoring tool. 

## Instructions: 

- Make each slide represent a key milestone or breakthrough moment in the development of the technology. 
- Use the map functionality to pinpoint where each major advancement took place. This will visualize the geographic spread.
- Integrate historical images, patent diagrams, videos or other multimedia that showcase how the technology looked and worked at each stage. 
- Include quotes or anecdotes that give a human perspective to each timeline entry. This connects the audience to the story.
- If possible, end with a slide that shows the modern incarnation of the technology and discusses its impact on society. Tie it back to the origin.
- Take advantage of features like zooming into map areas, making the images full bleed, and adding slide backgrounds to immerse users in each era and location. 
- Make sure to clearly explain any complex technical processes in simple, engaging language that is easy to understand. 
- Include a clear intro/title slide explaining the overall storyline and purpose at the outset. This provides context.
