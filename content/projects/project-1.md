title: "Project 1: Reel-to-Reel"
---

**Objective:** Capture a live musical performance using analog recording equipment to gain hands-on experience with mic placement, instrument selection, and utilizing the natural acoustics of a space. 

**Instructions:**

1. Gather 2-3 musicians to perform live in the studio. Select instruments that complement each other tonally and have suitable volume levels for an unamplified acoustic recording. 

2. Record using the reel-to-reel tape recorder and Toft mixer. Use the preamps on the Toft mixer. 

3. Create an echo chamber by routing audio from the mixer to an amp in one of the TCB rooms. Position a mic in that room to capture the echo and route it back to a channel on the mixer.

4. Mix the tracks live while recording the full performance in one take onto tape with no editing.

5. Submit a digital version of the the final recording, photos of the setup (recording, mixing and patch-bay), and a written reflection analyzing your process, microphone technique, use of effects, and the final mix to D2L. Discuss the challenges of live analog recording and your lessons learned.

6. You may work in groups but each submission should showcase different miking approaches and recorded songs.
