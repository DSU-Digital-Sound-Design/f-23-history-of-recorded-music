title: "Project 2: Record Sampling" 
---

For this project, you will create a 2-3 minute musical composition using only samples from pre-1980 vinyl records. You can sample from the records I provide in class, or you can bring in your own selections of older vinyl records to sample from. The goal is to creatively repurpose and rearrange brief samples from these vintage recordings into an original composition. 

When recording your samples, you can choose snippets from well-known, popular recordings or you can dig deeper to find more obscure, forgotten gems to sample from. Get creative with how you manipulate and layer the samples using editing software! 

In addition to the musical composition, you will complete a short 1-page written response discussing topics related to sampling pre-existing recordings, such as:

- Copyright and legal issues surrounding sampling 
- How sampling relates to concepts of originality and creativity in music
- Examples of groundbreaking uses of sampling in music history
- Your own insights into the process of creating an original composition from existing source material

The written component should demonstrate thoughtful consideration of how sampling and remixing pre-existing content raises important questions about copyright, creativity, and musical innovation. Please cite at least 2-3 sources to support your discussion.
