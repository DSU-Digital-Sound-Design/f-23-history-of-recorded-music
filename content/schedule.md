<!--

**Reading 3** - pick one article 

* [Music: Phonograph Boom - TIME](https://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,762553-1,00.html) - great article about the boom in record sales in 1939
* [Tattooed on their tongues : a journey through the backrooms of American music : Escott, Colin. aut : Free Download, Borrow, and Streaming : Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/tattooedontheirt00coli/page/54/mode/2up) - Decca Records - pg 54 - a few pages on Decca from the business perspective 
* [Gama Gilbert, “Record Renaissance,” New York Times Magazine (Jan. 7, 1940): 10.](https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1940/01/07/94758904.html?pageNumber=115) [pdf](https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1940/01/07/94758904.pdf?pdf_redirect=true&ip=0)- a nice historical picture of recording and reproduction up to that time
	* Summary - THE rapidly growing popular interest in good music is nowhere more strikingly indicated than by the current renaissance of the phonograph as an instrument of the home. A nation's appetite for good music grows by what it feeds on.
* Short articles on record collecting

	* This is fascinating that people wanted guides to buy records. As stated, “it has been written from the listeners, not the scholar’s point of view.” This was for music consumers, not historians. 
	* Have them read Chapter 1, "Getting Acquainted with Music on Record"
